# What Is Keylogging
Keylogging is the act of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to monitor the activity of employees, to spy on someone's computer use, or to steal login credentials and other sensitive information. Keylogging can be accomplished using software or hardware, and the logs of keystrokes can be saved locally or remotely. Some keyloggers are even designed to be undetectable and are used for malicious purposes.

# What Is a Keylogger
A keylogger is a piece of software or hardware that is used to record the keys struck on a keyboard. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as to monitor the activity of employees, to spy on someone's computer use, or to steal login credentials and other sensitive information. Keyloggers can be installed on a computer or device in a number of ways, such as through a malicious email attachment, by downloading infected software from the internet, or by physically installing a hardware keylogger onto the device. Keyloggers can record all keystrokes, including passwords and other sensitive information, and the logs of keystrokes can be saved locally or remotely. Some keyloggers are designed to be undetectable and are used for malicious purposes.

# Process of Keylogging
There are several ways that keylogging can be accomplished:
1.	Software keyloggers: These are programs that are installed on a computer or device and run in the background, recording all keystrokes made on the keyboard. They can be installed through a variety of methods, such as through a malicious email attachment or by downloading infected software from the internet.
2.	Hardware keyloggers: These are physical devices that are plugged into the keyboard or computer and record all keystrokes made on the keyboard. They are often small and difficult to detect, and can be used to record keystrokes even when the computer is turned off.
3.	Browser extensions: Some browser extensions, such as those that claim to improve typing speed or provide other productivity features, may also contain keylogging functionality.
Once a keylogger is installed, it will run in the background and record all keystrokes made on the keyboard. The logs of keystrokes can be saved locally on the computer or device, or they can be transmitted to a remote location for storage. The person using the computer or device may not be aware that their keystrokes are being logged, depending on the type of keylogger and how it has been installed

# Keylogger's Current Scenario
Keylogging is still a common tactic used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information and commit other crimes. Here is another example of a scenario in which keylogging might be used in today's world:
An individual becomes suspicious that their partner is cheating on them and wants to find out more. They install a keylogger on their partner's computer without their knowledge, hoping to catch them in the act. The keylogger runs in the background and records all keystrokes made on the keyboard, including login credentials for dating websites and messages sent through chat apps.
After reviewing the logs, the individual discovers that their partner has indeed been cheating and decides to end the relationship.
This is just one example of how keyloggers can be used in personal relationships. Keyloggers can also be used by employers to monitor their employees, by parents to monitor their children's internet activity, and by hackers to steal login credentials and other sensitive information. It is important to be aware of the potential risks and consequences of keylogging, and to use caution when installing any software or giving out login credentials.
